# Investment Robo Advisor
Most people are familiar with customer service phone wait times. You call customer service and receive this response: "The current wait time is 2 hours and 30 minutes" Customer service employees are busy and can only talk to so many people at once. This is where bots come in. Customers can chat with an online bot to receive the information they need instead of waiting on the phone to speak to a representative. Young people may also prefer this online chat experience to talking on the phone.

A retirement plan provider wants to increase their client portfolio, especially by engaging young people. To improve the customer experience and engage young people, the company decides to build a robo advisor. The robo advisor will provide investment portfolio recommendations for retirement. To create the bot, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and the Python language will be utilized.

## Technologies 
This project uses [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) and the standard Python 3.7 libraries. Two Amazon Web Services were used to create the bot:
* [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) - a fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) service with advanced natural language models to design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces in applications
* [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) - a serverless, event-driven compute service that lets you run code for virtually any type of application or backend service without provisioning or managing servers
